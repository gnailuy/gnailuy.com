As we know that `scp` is a command for secure copy, it copies files between hosts.
Generally, we follow the below two examples to copy a file from/to localhost to/from a remote machine:

<!-- more -->

``` bash
scp /path/to/filename username@hostname:/path/to/destination/directory/
scp username@hostsname:/path/to/filename /path/to/local/directory/
```

These commands and their deformations usually work fine.
But when I tried to scp a file to my VPS this afternoon, a problem arose:

``` bash
scp file\:name yuliang@gnailuy.com:
ssh: Could not resolve hostname example: Name or service not known
```

I Googled this problem for quite a while and finally found out that the culprit was the colon in the file name.
The solution to this problem turns out to be very simple:

``` bash
scp ./file\:name yuliang@gnailuy.com:
scp /path/to/file\:name yuliang@gnailuy.com:
```
