title: Spoofing MAC address in Archlinux

The first issue I met after I logged in to my newly installed Arch Linux, was that I had to change the MAC address to gain access to our campus network.
I have a short post [here][linux-mac] about how to spoof the MAC address in Linux.
In that article, I introduced how to change the MAC address temporarily using [ifconfig][ifconfig],
and how to edit the network configure file in Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora or Debian/Ubuntu.
But I found no `ifconfig` available in my new Arch Linux (I must had missed some essential package that provides `ifconfig` during the installation.).
So I had to find another method, and fortunately, there is an `Arch Way`.

According to the [Arch Wiki][archwiki], we can use [`macchanger`][macchanger] or [`ip`][ip] to make a temporary change of the MAC address:

``` bash
macchanger --mac=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

or

``` bash
ip link set dev eth0 down
ip link set dev eth0 address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
ip link set dev eth0 up
```

where `eth0` is the name of my wired network device. I didn't have `macchanger` installed on my system, so I used the second method above.
You may want to install a `macchanger` using the `pacman` command.
It can even generate a random MAC address to a device with the `r` parameter. Very interesting.

With the above two methods, the new MAC address will recover to its initial value after a reboot.
To spoof MAC on boot, the Arch Wiki gives us an `Arch Way`. We can create a file `/etc/rc.d/functions.d/macspoof` with the following content:

``` bash
spoof_mac() {
    ip link set dev eth0 address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
}
add_hook sysinit_end spoof_mac
```

This file adds a hook at the end of the system initial process with a function which use the `ip` command to change the MAC address on system boot.
