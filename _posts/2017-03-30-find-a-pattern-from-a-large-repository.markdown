When we want to look for some string patterns from files in a source code repository,
say a Git repository.
We often want to ignore those hidden directories such as `.git`, `.github`, etc.

<!-- more -->

The following command will do:

``` bash
cd the-repository-directory/
find . \( -path ./.idea -o -path ./.git -o -path ./.github \) -prune -o \
    -type f -exec grep -I your-string-here {} +
```

In this command, those `.idea`, `.git`, and `.github` are common hidden directories
that we usually don't want to look in.
