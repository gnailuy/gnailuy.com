Ever in a situation when you want to find a string pattern from a large
source code repository, with tons of text files, binarys, and also hidden directories?

<!-- more -->

Try the following command:

``` bash
cd the-repository-directory/
find . \( -path ./.idea -o -path ./.git -o -path ./.github \) -prune -o \
    -type f -exec grep -I your-string-here {} +
```

where .idea, .git, and .github are common hidden directories that you
usually don't want to look into.
