Process scheduling in [the Linux kernel][kernel-archives].

<!-- more -->

## Process scheduling

In modern systems, there are usually many processes that are in `TASK_RUNNING` state, which means they are ready to run.
It is the kernel's job to decide which process to run, and how long to run it.
This is done by the kernel scheduler, a [kernel subsystem][linux-kernel-map] that is responsible for scheduling the processes.

Most modern operating systems, including Linux, employs preemptive multitasking.
In this model, each process is assigned a slice of CPU time to run, then it will be preempted by the kernel scheduler.
The scheduler then decides which process to run next, and how long its time slice will be.
A process can also relinquishes its CPU slice, for example when a process need to wait for a resource to become available.
The scheduler also needs to select the next process if this happens.

When a processor changes to a new process, the scheduler is responsible for saving the state of the previous process,
including the registers (including the program counter) and the memory address space.
This is often referred to as the `context` of a process, thus switching from one process to another is called `context switch`.

### What to consider when scheduling

The processor scheduler runs every time the system needs to decide which process to run.
Each time it runs, the input is a given set of runnable processes, and the output is the process to run next.
In a scheduler design, many things need to be considered.

* Process type

Processes can be classified into two types: I/O-bound or CPU-bound.

Most desktop GUI applications are I/O-bound, because they spend most of their time waiting for user input or output.
These processes usually do not run for long periods of time, and tends to stop running voluntarily to wait for I/O events.
Conversely, CPU-bound processes tend to spend much of their time executing code, until they are preempted by the kernel scheduler.

However, I/O-bound processes are often latency-sensitive, which means they often require a quick response time,
since otherwise users may be waiting for a long time for the application to respond.
While CPU-bound processes usually do not expect to be responsive.

* Priority

A common way to rank processes is to give them a priority.
Ideally, a process with a higher priority runs before a lower priority, or runs for a longer time than a lower priority.

* Speed

Since Linux kernel 2.5, a new scheduler named `O(1)` scheduler is introduced.
It can perform its work in constant time, which is a big improvement over the previous `O(n)` scheduler.

* Latency and throughput

The scheduler in the system needs to consider both high throughput and fast response time.
The `O(1)` scheduler has some issues when it comes to latency-sensitive tasks.
It is ideal for large server workloads, which lack of interactive processes, but performed poorly on desktop systems.
Since Linux kernel 2.6.23, the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) replaces the `O(1)` scheduler to improve the interactive performance.

* Real-time requirement

There might also be real-time processes, which need to run before a certain deadline.
And the kernel scheduler also need to consider the real-time requirement.

### Scheduler classes

The Linux kernel uses modular schedulers to support different types of processes.
This is implemented by the **scheduler class** approach.

A scheduler class implements a specific scheduling algorithm for a certain process type.
For example, we have the real-time scheduler class `rt_sched_class` for real-time processes,
and the CFS scheduler class `fair_sched_class` for normal processes.

The scheduler classes have priorities, and they are chained together in the order of priority.
The kernel uses a core scheduler to iterate over the scheduler classes,
and uses the result of the first scheduler class that produces a valid scheduling decision.

In the source code I am working on (linux-next commit: `09688c0166e7`),the scheduler classes are ordered by
the linker script: `./include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h` (Line 127 in commit `09688c0166e7`).

``` c
#define SCHED_DATA                              \
        STRUCT_ALIGN();                         \
        __begin_sched_classes = .;              \
        *(__idle_sched_class)                   \
        *(__fair_sched_class)                   \
        *(__rt_sched_class)                     \
        *(__dl_sched_class)                     \
        *(__stop_sched_class)                   \
        __end_sched_classes = .;
```

Scheduler class instances are defined in separate files in the `./kernel/sched/` directory.
For example, CFS scheduler class is defined in `./kernel/sched/fair.c` (Line 11735 in commit `09688c0166e7`).
The helper macro `DEFINE_SCHED_CLASS` helps to align the scheduler instances to guarantee the layout in memory.

``` c
DEFINE_SCHED_CLASS(fair) = {
        .enqueue_task           = enqueue_task_fair,
        .dequeue_task           = dequeue_task_fair,
// ...
        .pick_next_task         = __pick_next_task_fair,
        .put_prev_task          = put_prev_task_fair,
        .set_next_task          = set_next_task_fair,
// ...
        .task_tick              = task_tick_fair,
// ...
        .update_curr            = update_curr_fair,
// ...
};
```

A scheduler class contains a set of methods that implement the scheduling algorithm.
Important ones are `enqueue_task()`, `dequeue_task()`, `pick_next_task()`, `put_prev_task()`, `task_tick()`, etc..

The core scheduler iterates over scheduler classes by using the `for_each_class` macro in `./kernel/sched/sched.h`,
which iterators over the `SCHED_DATA` from the `__end_sched_classes` to the `__begin_sched_classes` in `./include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h`.
You can find the uses of `for_each_class` in `./kernel/sched/core.c` (Line 5633 in commit `09688c0166e7`).

``` c
        for_each_class(class) {
                p = class->pick_next_task(rq);
                if (p)
                        return p;
        }

        BUG(); /* The idle class should always have a runnable task. */
```

### The scheduler body

The function `__schedule()` in `./kernel/sched/core.c` (Line 6182 in commit `09688c0166e7`) is the main body of the Linux scheduler.
What this function does includes:

1. Put the previously running task into a run queue and pick up a new task to run next (in `pick_next_task()`);
2. Call `context_switch()` function to actually switch to the new task;

``` c
static void __sched notrace __schedule(unsigned int sched_mode)
{
// ...
    cpu = smp_processor_id();
    rq = cpu_rq(cpu);
    prev = rq->curr;
// ...
    next = pick_next_task(rq, prev, &rf);
// ...
    if (likely(prev != next)) {
        rq->nr_switches++;
// ...
        RCU_INIT_POINTER(rq->curr, next);
// ...
        rq = context_switch(rq, prev, next);
// ...
    }
// ...
}
```

In the function body above, the `rq` returned from the `cpu_rq(cpu)` call is called a run queue.
Ready threads are enqueued into run queues by the scheduler.
Each CPU has its own run queue, and one ready thread belongs to a single run queue at a time.
You can find the run queue data structure defined in the `./kernel/sched/sched.h` (Line 926 in commit `09688c0166e7`).

The `pick_next_task()` calls the `__pick_next_task()` function in `./kernel/sched/core.c` line 5603 (in commit `09688c0166e7`),
which uses the `for_each_class` macro to iterate the scheduler classes to find the next task (Code in line 5633 showed in the above section).

Similarly, the `pick_next_task()` function also calls the `put_prev_task()` defined in `./kernel/sched/sched.h` (Line 2188 in commit `09688c0166e7`),
which actually delegates the work to the scheduler class of the previous task:

``` c
static inline void put_prev_task(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *prev)
{
        WARN_ON_ONCE(rq->curr != prev);
        prev->sched_class->put_prev_task(rq, prev);
}
```

The `__schedule()` function is called whenever there is a need to reschedule tasks.
For example after interrupt handling, or when a task calls `sched_yield()` to relinquish the CPU.
There is also a function `scheduler_tick()` which is called periodically by the kernel to check if a task is running for too long.

## The CFS scheduler

Since Linux kernel 2.6.23, the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is the default scheduler for normal processes.

The main idea behind the CFS is to maintain balance of processor time among tasks.
This means processes should be given a fair amount of the processor.
When one or more tasks are not given a fair amount of time relative to others, then those out-of-balance tasks should be given time to execute.

To achieve this, the CFS maintains the amount of time a given task has used in a concept called **virtual runtime**
(`vruntime` in `./kernel/sched/sched.h` line 547 in commit `09688c0166e7`).

The smaller a `vruntime` is, which means the task has been assigned less CPU time, the higher its priority in the next rescheduling process.
The Linux kernel uses a red-black tree to maintain processes by the virtual runtime
(`rb_node` in `./kernel/sched/sched.h` line 541 in commit `09688c0166e7`).

</center>

In CFS, the task with the smallest `vruntime` is the next task to run. The `vruntime` of a process is calculated based on the priority of the process.

### Process priority

The Linux kernel scheduler uses two different types of priority: the real-time priority, and the `nice` value.

#### Real-time priority

A real-time priority is a number from 0 to 99 by default, and higher real-time priority means higher priority.
The real-time priority is used by the real-time scheduler.
It is optional to set a real-time priority for a process, and all real-time processes are at a higher priority than normal processes.

You can check the real-time priority of a process by the `RTPRIO` column in the `ps` or `top` command.
If the value is `-`, it means the process is not real-time.

#### Nice value

A `nice` value is a number from -20 to 19, where -20 is the highest priority and 19 is the lowest priority, and 0 is the default priority.
Note that larger `nice` value means lower priority, as the process is being 'nice' to other processes.

You can see the `nice` value of a process by using the `ps` or `top` command and checking the `NI` column.
There is also a `nice` command that can be used to set the `nice` value of a process.

Each `nice` value is mapped to a **weight** value, which is used by the CFS to calculate `vruntime`.
The `nice` to **weight** map is defined in the `./kernel/sched/core.c` file (Line 10895 in commit `09688c0166e7`).

``` c
const int sched_prio_to_weight[40] = {
 /* -20 */     88761,     71755,     56483,     46273,     36291,
 /* -15 */     29154,     23254,     18705,     14949,     11916,
 /* -10 */      9548,      7620,      6100,      4904,      3906,
 /*  -5 */      3121,      2501,      1991,      1586,      1277,
 /*   0 */      1024,       820,       655,       526,       423,
 /*   5 */       335,       272,       215,       172,       137,
 /*  10 */       110,        87,        70,        56,        45,
 /*  15 */        36,        29,        23,        18,        15,
};
```

And the `vruntime` is calculated as:

$$
vruntime=(actual\;runtime) * \frac{(weight\;of\;nice\;0)}{process\;weight}
$$

In the kernel source, the `vruntime` is updated in the `update_curr()` function,
which in the CFS scheduler is the `update_curr_fair()` (Line 884 in `./kernel/sched/fair.c`),
which in turn calls its own implementation of `update_curr()` in line 844.

When the CFS reschedule function is called, it calls the `pick_next_task_fair()` to choose the next task
(Line 7213 in `./kernel/sched/fair.c`),
which calls a subroutine `pick_next_entity()` (Line 4506) to do the actual work.

``` c
static struct sched_entity *
pick_next_entity(struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq, struct sched_entity *curr)
{
        struct sched_entity *left = __pick_first_entity(cfs_rq);
        struct sched_entity *se;
// ...
        se = left; /* ideally we run the leftmost entity */

        if (cfs_rq->skip && cfs_rq->skip == se) {
                struct sched_entity *second;
// ...
                if (second && wakeup_preempt_entity(second, left) < 1)
                        se = second;
        }

        if (cfs_rq->next && wakeup_preempt_entity(cfs_rq->next, left) < 1) {
// ...
                se = cfs_rq->next;
        } else if (cfs_rq->last && wakeup_preempt_entity(cfs_rq->last, left) < 1) {
// ...
                se = cfs_rq->last;
// ...
        return se;
}
```
